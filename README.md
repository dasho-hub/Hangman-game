# Word Guessing Game (Hangman Classic)

This is one of my early projects, created while learning the basics of C# and console applications.

The goal was to build a simple word game without using advanced OOP techniques, focusing instead on:
- Loops and conditional logic
- String manipulation
- User input handling

Since then, Iâ€™ve learned object-oriented design, but I keep this project as a milestone of my learning journey.
